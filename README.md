# Yukthi Opus (YO): Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimizer  
### A Multi-Chain MCMC–Greedy–Simulated Annealing Framework for Large-Scale Optimization

This repository contains the full implementation of **Yukthi Opus (YO)**, the hybrid metaheuristic optimizer proposed in the accompanying research paper. YO integrates:

- **MCMC global exploration**
- **Greedy local refinement**
- **Simulated Annealing with adaptive reheating**
- **Blacklist-based region filtering**
- **Multi-chain parallel execution**

The repository also includes **all benchmark scripts**, reproducibility notebooks, figures, result logs, and configuration files used in the experiments.
